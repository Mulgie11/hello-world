My ideas and other twaddle

Hi all, just getting back into programming after a long hiatus due to (what I'm hoping will be) a new and exciting job role.  
Consequently, I'm now getting myself acquainted with Github, Java (and Eclipse), Python (and Jupyter Notebook) plus various other bits and bobs! :)
